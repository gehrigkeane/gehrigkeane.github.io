# Welcome Friends and Family!
---

The following web-page covers wedding information for Andrea and I, below you'll find a time-line, directions, and location information. 

Parents, I can't emphasize enough how grateful Andrea and I are for all of the help you've provided bringing our impromptu wedding together. We recognize such spontaneous plans have likely elevated feelings of stress this holiday season, and for that we apologize. We've been searching for wedding scenarios that are true to our relationship for a while now, and the relaxed ceremonies defined below very much resonate with both of us. 

Finally, we'd like to emphasize that the aim for our wedding is relaxed, comfortable, and Family/Friends centric. **Wear what you want!** We'll be dressed all fancy because it's fun, you're more than welcome to follow suit *(\*\*no pun intended\*\*)*, but Christmas sweaters or pajamas are entirely welcome!

Our vision of the ceremonies is as follows: Arrival at the Livingston residence around 3:30PM. Loose socialization and hors d'oeuvres until everyone arrives and has been introduced. Around 3:45PM Andrea and I will announce our thanks to everyone in attendance, and then recite our vows to one another. Proceeding vows we'll sign the marriage license and begin pictures! Finally, after the mothers are sated we'll depart for Dinner!

The full menu is available and cheese cake will be served when I give the word (*Note: only when I give the word*). Parking is available just north of the Broadview hotel or in the parking garage directly to the east.
